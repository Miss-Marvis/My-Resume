<p>For as long as i remember, I have always loved tech, I mean being a tech sis but i was limited by so many things, from
    not being able to afford a fee for any tech programs to not having a laptop to support my dreams, when i get asked what 
    skill i want, I always knew within me that i belonged in tech, If you spend time with me for minutes,
     you will confirm this cause i'm always on my gadgets, lol

    Late last year, I was able to afford a laptop for my self and i enrolled in a tech bootcamp, where i was introduced to various
    tech courses. I fell in love with building and designing web, it's just amazing to be able to create magical things, you know
    making your ideas come to reality.

<p>I looked forward to buying Dr Angela's Web development courses online, when it was on sale on Udemy, I took advantage of it and bought
    her courses. She is simply amazing, It dosen't feel like i'm learning online, It feels like she physically
     speaks directly to me, I understand her so well, I bless the day i came across her courses.  Thank you Dr Angela, you are the best!
     I look forward to building my career in tech and being the best in what i do.
